STARTING
https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/the-first-steps-to-starting-an-art-business
- You believe in yourself and your abilities, and that’s the all-important first step
- many artists let excuses and fear—fear of the unknown, fear of taking risks, fear of failure—stop them from even trying
- Establishing yourself in the artist community and making a living from your work is not going to happen overnight
- It will take planning, time, effort, dedication, and a devotion to lifelong learning
- You're selling a product (artwork) to people (collectors) who find value in it
- Start by defining your art practice.
- What is your mission? 
- How will you define success?
- What short and long-term goals will help you achieve these?
- narrow down who your buyers are and how to win them over
- what income levels can afford your work?
- where do these clients tend to shop for art?

PRICING

- know your costs and make sure they are covered in the price of your artwork
- costs you should remember to include: time, materials, shipping, and even framing
- you have a unique skill set that people value and are willing to give you compensation in exchange for your services
- you are providing a service along with a final product
- decide on a reasonable hourly wage
- the US Department of Labor lists the average hourly wage for a fine artist as $24.58
- justify a dollar amount for the size of the work
- your skill level and education may play a factor
- always make sure there’s still a profit left for you at the end by factoring in your costs
- price consistently to maintain a more positive relationship with galleries and collectors
- consider offering artwork at multiple price points (Not all fans of your work will be able to afford a $3000 piece)
- smaller, less expensive pieces are more attainable for buyers who can’t afford more costly works (cast a wider net)
