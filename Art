STARTING
https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/the-first-steps-to-starting-an-art-business
- You believe in yourself and your abilities, and that’s the all-important first step
- many artists let excuses and fear—fear of the unknown, fear of taking risks, fear of failure—stop them from even trying
- Establishing yourself in the artist community and making a living from your work is not going to happen overnight
- It will take planning, time, effort, dedication, and a devotion to lifelong learning
- You're selling a product (artwork) to people (collectors) who find value in it
- Start by defining your art practice.
- What is your mission? 
- How will you define success?
- What short and long-term goals will help you achieve these?
- narrow down who your buyers are and how to win them over
- what income levels can afford your work?
- where do these clients tend to shop for art?

MIXED MEDIA COLLAGES
It takes long for paint and glue to dry. 
Also remember to take into consideration the time it takes to assess the composition of a painting 
everytime there are new changes made.

PRICING
https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/an-artist-s-guide-to-making-a-business-plan-in-just-6-steps
- know your costs and make sure they are covered in the price of your artwork
- costs you should remember to include: time, materials, shipping, and even framing
- you have a unique skill set that people value and are willing to give you compensation in exchange for your services
- you are providing a service along with a final product
- decide on a reasonable hourly wage
- the US Department of Labor lists the average hourly wage for a fine artist as $24.58
- justify a dollar amount for the size of the work
- your skill level and education may play a factor
- always make sure there’s still a profit left for you at the end by factoring in your costs
- price consistently to maintain a more positive relationship with galleries and collectors
- consider offering artwork at multiple price points (Not all fans of your work will be able to afford a $3000 piece)
- smaller, less expensive pieces are more attainable for buyers who can’t afford more costly works (cast a wider net)

- Supply and demand: prices go up as inventory goes down, not the other way around.
- It’s more sustainable to sell five sculptures at $2000, than to sell one at $5000.
- Plan your future pricing, always asking, “Is this increase sustainable?”
- Your prices are only as legitimate as the integrity of your market, never sell for less.
- When you receive a price request, be it in-person, over email or social media — having a master price list is critical.
- Takeaway: Pricing is a major mystery in Contemporary Art, transparency will facilitate sales.

ESTABLISHING MARKET
When you string together a series of sales — you have built a market, for market to stabilize and grow do this:
- Document all sales and transactions.
- Establish pricing integrity.
- Communicate with your collectors frequently — keeping them apprised of your successes.
- having a master price list is critical. A few tips:Include all available works — your collector’s preferences might surprise you.
- Create a distinct URL and make it password protected — bonus: you can monitor traffic to the page via Google Analytics.
- Add relevant information: sales tax, shipping details and helpful articles on collecting art.
- Keep the information updated, and archive your previous lists.

THE WAR OF ART 
Mini-Course - Steven Pressfield
PART 1 
https://stevenpressfield.com/woa-mini-course/part-1/
"Our unlived life is living inside us at the same time that we're living our regular life. 
And what stops us is the question...  What stops us is Resistance - Resistance with a capital "R."" 

PART 2

Dalai Lama says,”The enemy is a great teacher.”

**What kind of forms does Resistance actually take in real life?
1) Resistance as a voice inside our heads and that voice tells us that we’re worthless, 
that our idea for our book or whatever it is, is just not worth pursuing.
It’s been done a million times before. Thousands of other writers have done it. 
They’ve all done it better than we will. We’ll never be able to stand out. 
undermining our belief in ourselves and our faith in the dream that we aspire to bring into being. 
2) it tempts us with distractions; let’s go out and party, let’s smoke a joint, you know, let’s get on Twitter, let’s watch TV
the distractions are all designed by Resistance to produce incapacity. 
It wants to knock us out of the game. Stop us from doing it
anything that will stop us from sitting down and doing our work.

**What about laws of Resistance? Does it have these certain principles? 
Can we learn different things to fight Resistance in a better way?
Resistance is a force of nature. It’s an objective force just like gravity,  it follows certain rules.

1)The more important a project is to the evolution—the healthy evolution of your soul—the more Resistance you will feel to starting. 
The more important that novel is for you going forward as an evolved human being to realize yourself, 
If you’re going to sit down and write a grocery list, you won’t feel any Resistance at all, 
but if you’re going to sit down and write Moby Dick, you’re going to feel the monumental Resistance. 
we can use the level of Resistance that we feel in our heart
as our heart is palpitating, when we think of this, we just need to ask it to tell us what we should do,
Let’s say we have 10 ideas that we’re thinking about. We ask ourselves, “Which one am I most afraid of?” 
Whatever that is, that’s the one you have to do.
The more important an activity is to the evolution of our soul, the more Resistance we will feel to it.

2) Resistance appears at very predictable moments in the course of any project that we’re working on
Resistance will appear first at the absolute outset before we’ve even started.
Then sometimes we will plunge in to a project in just a rush of inspiration.
Then Resistance is going to hit us at that point and it’s going to say—
it’s sort of like if we were in a ship and we’ve just sailed out of sight of shore and suddenly we get struck with terror, 
we look back going, “Oh my God, what happened? Where, where’s the land? 
You know, where are, where are we, why have we started to do this? 
We should never have done this. It’s a terrible mistake, and so on and so forth.”
There are certain predictable points in every project.
“second act blues”
at the very end and then after—after we finished this there’s another one
 If you think about running a marathon, there’s a concept of “hitting the wall.”
 the body’s glycogen supplies run out at 22 miles for whatever reason and the body has to shift to start burning fat.
 all of a sudden the bottom drops out of your energy and you just feel like you’re ready to collapse
 If we know that in advance, when you hit the wall, you say to yourself, 
 as you feel this terrible pain in your body starts freezing up, you say to yourself, 
 “Oh, I see what’s happening. I’ve just hit the wall. I think that my glycogen reserves are depleted.”
 And so you can rally from that and keep going. 
 The more we know about Resistance, the better we can combat it, the more we understand its rules and principles.
 “When in doubt it’s Resistance.”
 
 3) Resistance always appears second.
 if we are suddenly overwhelmed by fear, 
 self-sabotage, the desire to procrastinate, to distract ourselves, etc., 
 any of the symptoms of Resistance about a project
 The good news is this project that we’re so terrified of is vitally important to the evolution of our soul and we have to do it.
 So we’re onto something. In other words, we’ve struck gold and if we feel this huge Resistance to it, 
 it’s a good sign because now all we have to do is confront that project and do the work.
 
 **What would be the characteristics of Resistance if it were a monster?
  it’s invisible. We can’t see it. We can’t touch it. We can’t measure it. 
  But we can feel it. That’s for sure.
  Resistance is internal. It’s a voice inside our heads. It’s impulses inside ourselves.
  Resistance is insidious. It is highly intelligent, highly creative. It will morph itself into all kinds of forms. 
  it’s implacable.
  Resistance is truly not out just to stop us from doing our work. It’s out to kill us. 
  It is Evil with a capital “E.”
  Resistance is also impersonal. 
  It feels like when we hear that voice in our head that says, you’re a loser, you’re a bum, and it’s very specific to us.
  It’ll seduce us, it’ll terrify us. It’s diabolical and different ways that it can present itself to us.
  It doesn’t know who you are. It doesn’t care. It just wants to destroy you. 
  That’s all there is to it. 
  it will always operate according to its principles. 
  So when you feel enormous Resistance to a project, that’s an infallible sign that that project is super important to you.
  Resistance is universal
  When you hear that monster voice inside you, and when you feel paralyzed with fear, 
  when you’re compelled to self-destruct, remember you’re not alone. 
  You’re not a bad person, you’re not a weak person, for experiencing what you feel.
