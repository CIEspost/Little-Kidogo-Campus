CUSTOMER NEEDS
-  great business addresses a real customer need
- ```you have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.```
- when you try to reverse-engineer the need statement from the product, it’s too easy to lose touch with reality
- when I didn’t lead with the need, it was often greeted with confused looks (giving people ‘answer’ without asking them the ‘question’)
- **For startups, the need is all that really matters.**
- It’s the foundation of your entire business 
- It’s how you position your product (the ‘why’)
- It can trigger powerful emotions, like empathy, and disgust, on command.
- Every need is contextual (felt by a particular person, at a particular time, in pursuit of a particular end-goal)
- it has a functional side e.g., ‘I need to make my house look beautiful’
- and an emotional side — e.g., ‘I need attention from my friend’
- And needs find a way of getting themselves met . . . with your product or without it (look at how they currently meet it)
- find a way to express your customer need that builds empathy with an early-adopting niche
- clarifies the functional and emotional aspects of the need
- avoids the trap of working backwards from the product
- Write a compelling need narrative (make people’s lives better, prioritise features, communicateeffectively, hone on niche) 
- For ___[target audience], 
- it’s a constant challenge to ___[general problem]. 
- Every ___[time period], 
- these people ___[perform a key activity] (What are customers doing while they use your product)
- in order to ___[achieve a primary goal]. 
- This is especially true if you’re a [niche].
- The main problem they face is ___[primary functional problem relating to activity] (Hardest part about doing the activity today?)
- which leads to ___[bad/worst case outcomes]. (Bad/worst case outcomes: What’s the worst case scenario if the activity goes wrong?)
- Today, their best option is ___[substitutes], (Substitutes: What’s the next-best-option or workaround?)
- but of course, they ___[the most common complaints of each substitute]. (Why do customers hate these substitutes?)
- With ___[key trend], the problem will only get worse over time. (What will make this problem worse in the future?)
- If only there was a easier/better/cheaper way to ___[perform a key activity], 
- then customers could ___[quantifiable impact on their primary goal] (How can you measure the impact of solving the problem?)
- which would lead to ___[positive outcomes / emotions]. (What good things happen as a result?)
- With ___[number of potential customers], there is a clear opportunity to meaningfully impact a huge number of people.
- To bring the message to life, use specific language and vivid metaphors. 
- try it out on both potential customers and lay people
- anyone who hears it should be able to put themselves in your customer’s shoes
- When potential customers hear it, they should self-identify with every point.
- Once they validate the need, try asking them to guess what your product does to address it
- Not only might they come up with good ideas, but they might also expect far less from you than you originally thought.
