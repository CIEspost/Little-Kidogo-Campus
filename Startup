CUSTOMER NEEDS
-  great business addresses a real customer need
- ```you have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.```
- when you try to reverse-engineer the need statement from the product, it’s too easy to lose touch with reality
- when I didn’t lead with the need, it was often greeted with confused looks (giving people ‘answer’ without asking them the ‘question’)
- **For startups, the need is all that really matters.**
- It’s the foundation of your entire business 
- It’s how you position your product (the ‘why’)
- It can trigger powerful emotions, like empathy, and disgust, on command.
- Every need is contextual (felt by a particular person, at a particular time, in pursuit of a particular end-goal)
- it has a functional side e.g., ‘I need to make my house look beautiful’
- and an emotional side — e.g., ‘I need attention from my friend’
- And needs find a way of getting themselves met . . . with your product or without it (look at how they currently meet it)
- find a way to express your customer need that builds empathy with an early-adopting niche
- clarifies the functional and emotional aspects of the need
- avoids the trap of working backwards from the product
- Write a compelling need narrative (make people’s lives better, prioritise features, communicateeffectively, hone on niche) 
- For ___[target audience], 
- it’s a constant challenge to ___[general problem]. 
- Every ___[time period], 
- these people ___[perform a key activity] (What are customers doing while they use your product)
- in order to ___[achieve a primary goal]. 
- This is especially true if you’re a [niche].
- The main problem they face is ___[primary functional problem relating to activity] (Hardest part about doing the activity today?)
- which leads to ___[bad/worst case outcomes]. (Bad/worst case outcomes: What’s the worst case scenario if the activity goes wrong?)
- Today, their best option is ___[substitutes], (Substitutes: What’s the next-best-option or workaround?)
- but of course, they ___[the most common complaints of each substitute]. (Why do customers hate these substitutes?)
- With ___[key trend], the problem will only get worse over time. (What will make this problem worse in the future?)
- If only there was a easier/better/cheaper way to ___[perform a key activity], 
- then customers could ___[quantifiable impact on their primary goal] (How can you measure the impact of solving the problem?)
- which would lead to ___[positive outcomes / emotions]. (What good things happen as a result?)
- With ___[number of potential customers], there is a clear opportunity to meaningfully impact a huge number of people.
- To bring the message to life, use specific language and vivid metaphors. 
- try it out on both potential customers and lay people
- anyone who hears it should be able to put themselves in your customer’s shoes
- When potential customers hear it, they should self-identify with every point.
- Once they validate the need, try asking them to guess what your product does to address it
- Not only might they come up with good ideas, but they might also expect far less from you than you originally thought.

PRESENTING YOUR VISION
https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-great-founders-make-their-vision-sound-inevitable-4dadb232aae7
If you’ve ever felt your vision was hard to capture, you’re not alone.
I started investing in startups, and I found myself asking founders to tell me about their ‘big vision’. 
I wanted to feel as excited about their idea as they were. But I needed more than a fuzzy statement to get me excited.

**What makes a vision compelling?
a vision should describe an inspiring future product that will help a large number of people — and make lots of money in the process.
Great founders make their vision seem inevitable
spotting emerging trends and extrapolating them by five years
When they describe their vision, it’s their logic that convinces you — not magic.
You don’t need to be a visionary to have a vision. 
You just need to connect current technology and economic trends to future customer needs.
‘The best companies almost always have a clear “why now?” Nature hates a vacuum — so why hasn’t your solution been built before now?’
The best answer to ‘why now’ isn’t a 10-year trend, it’s a recent watershed moment in your technology, 
regulatory or competitive environment, that enables you to succeed where previous attempts have failed. 
For example, Uber would have been impossible before the existence of smartphones with GPS.

**Writing a compelling ‘vision verse’
convey exactly where your venture could end up, and do so in an inspiring, inevitable and investable way.
Our vision is that ____[performing a key activity] **what activity are your customers engaged in when they use your product or service?
will be as easy as ____[helpful comparison].**what’s a good metaphor or comparison to get your idea across in as few words as possible? 
E.g., ‘As easy as calling an Uber.’
Over the last decade, we’ve seen ____[three relevant trends].**what ongoing macro-eco,consumer&tech trends point in direction of vision?
Imagine if you were able to ____[achieve inspiring outcome(s)]**what will they achieve in future that's impossible to achieve today? 
with just ___[minimal user input].**what’s the minimal action that customers can take to achieve this outcome in the future? 
We’ll actually be able to deliver this as soon as we ____[critical areas to develop in the company].
** how can you hint at what you’ll need to achieve as a business without going into too much detail?
These trends are set to accelerate, now that ____[watershed technology, regulatory or competitive milestones].
**What has recently changed in your technology, regulatory or competitive environments that previously made your vision impossible?
Once this is possible, our addressable market suddenly opens up from ____[current niche customer segments]
** which customers do you focus on today?
to include ____[larger potential customer segments].**which customers will you target in the future? Can you quantify them?
Eventually, we can eliminate ____[injustice of the status quo].**what’s wrong with current situation that vision highlights & improve?
And that’s a vision we believe is worth fighting for.

**Why visions matter
It’s thrilling to get a glimpse of the future.
 Trends and watershed moments give your vision a solid footing in today’s reality. 
 researching trends is a great exercise to help you see the bigger picture and define the direction your company will take.
 Ensure that your company’s success becomes as obvious to others as it is to you.
 Share your vision with investors, your team, potential customers, to help them get as excited about the future as you are.
